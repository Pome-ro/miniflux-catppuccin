# Miniflux Catppuccin

This repo holds a simple `theme.css` file for [miniflux](https://miniflux.app), along with screenshots to show what the theme looks like, and instructions on how to use it. This is still a work in progress, however I am sharing it at this point as it is a useable state.

## Installation

To use this catppuccin theme in an instance of miniflux, log into the miniflux application, then go to `Settings > Application Settings > Custom CSS` and paste the contents of `theme.css` into the entry box. Then hit the update button.

## Customization

If you would like to customize the css further, you can either do so directly in the input box within the application, or in a text editor and then re-paste and save. 

## Contributions

I am open to contributions to the theme, so long as they align with the [catppuccin mocha style](https://github.com/catppuccin/catppuccin). You can also make similar styles for latte, frappe, and macchiato and submit those as pull request!
